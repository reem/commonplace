"""|sides of an n=3 hypercube| ways of looking at a..

square
Not an equilateral rectangle,
perfectly symmetrical
Not the second simplest shape,
made with lines
Not the shadow of a tesseract,
projected to a plane
No.

It's a square.
Not a regular quadrilateral
It's a square
Not an n=2 hypercube
It's a square
Not the most efficient shape
No.

It is JUST a square.
boring by loathsome
with area I hate math

Ya. I wonder why.

"""the sky bleeds Coca-Cola
Knives pierced the sky
drenched in sky
drenched in blood

coke adds life
america's real choice
red white and you
always coca cola

Knives blotted out the sun
Knives slashes the blanket of stars

the people's ambition
fails to extend beyond
their pockets - their little squares of light
dollars and apples and coke

their dreams replaced
by the blood of the sky

designed by apple in california""",


"""keyboards go clack
clickity clickity clack
It's the most annoying
and most powerful
sound in the world
click click clack

The sound of generation
of pure
and infinite
creation
it is it, it is!
it means meaning
click click click

tap in to the power
power of billions -
billions and billions -
every second

processors are silent

fans go whir

click clack whir
It gets loud when you push it
like a child
whines and yells
WHIRRRRRRRRRRRR

it'll do what you want
stupidly, sometimes.
don't forget
to check
am I on fire?
click WHIR click clack

and it complains
and complains
and complains
but with the clack
of a keyboard
you can do anything.

WHIRRRRRRRRRRRRRR

What's the collatz chain of 15,000 factorial?
WHIRRRRRRR
No problem.

What's the billionth fibonacci number?
WHIRRRRRRRR
No problem.

Burn through 'em.
That's the power
of click click clack
WHIRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR""",

"""My eyes feel like they're going to push themselves into my skull
It's late
and it was late last night
and the night before
and the night before

There is an approximately gold light
and an approximately brown couch
and an approximately tree table
with my approximately 100 hours on it
and many of them still left undone

out the window its black
and it sounds black
quiet

except for little beeps and bloops
and a special little black box
where white letters jump into reality
following perfectly clicky clacks

the bed tempts
but the box is strong
so I wait
and it gets late""",

"""plunge
the glass shatters beneath your feet
and warps around you, a rush of fire and air
as it blankets you

in an instant it
smothers you
blots out the world
no space
except everywhere
no color
except blue
no sound
except heart
no anything
except yourself

you smell nothing
you touch nothing
you see nothing
you hear nothing
you know yourself

unadulterated

then it breaks
it roars and pulls you up
the world feels so loud
as it snaps you out of the void

the world smells water
the world tastes chlorine
the world feels cold
the world sees you
the world screams
the world grasps take you
away from you

then its quiet again
and life beats regular"""
